# DG Script Generation
The script generator is used to create new script files and place them in predefined folders which you can easily change.

Easy way to make new templates and keep your project organized.

You setup a base folder, defaults to "Assets/Scripts", and for example you want to create a Unity DOTS System, you select that type in the tool, write a script name and click create script.
This will output an empty script in the folder "Assets/Scripts/Systems" by default.
